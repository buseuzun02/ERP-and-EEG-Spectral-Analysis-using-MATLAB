# ERP and EEG Spectral Analysis using MATLAB

This project analyzes **Event-Related Potentials (ERP)** from synthetic EEG datasets using various spectral estimation techniques implemented in MATLAB. It demonstrates the comparison of time-domain and frequency-domain methods for signal characterization and noise identification.

## Key Features
- **ERP Computation:** Extracted ERP waveforms from multiple synthetic EEG datasets.  
- **Spectral Estimation Methods:** Applied FFT on ERP and averaged FFTs across trials to reveal phase-locking properties.  
- **Noise Characterization:** Matched datasets to white, pink (1/f), and uniform noise based on spectral properties.  
- **Time-Frequency Analysis:** Used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to detect narrow-band transient oscillations with precise temporal and frequency localization.  
- **Signal Mixture Analysis:** Identified and separated multiple band-limited components, analyzing their center frequencies and bandwidths.  
- **MATLAB Implementation:** All analyses implemented with reproducible MATLAB scripts.

## Purpose
Designed for biomedical signal processing practice, this project demonstrates how **ERP and EEG analyses** can uncover underlying signal properties, evaluate phase-locking, and perform accurate timeâ€“frequency characterizations of neural signals.
